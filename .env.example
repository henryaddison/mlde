# CUDA-related:
# You may need to fiddle with LIBRARY_PATH and/or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (e.g. if using pixi or wsl or conda)
# For example,
# pixi
# export LIBRARY_PATH=${PWD}/.pixi/envs/default/lib:${LIBRARY_PATH}
# wsl
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/wsl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# conda
# LIBRARY_PATH="${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
